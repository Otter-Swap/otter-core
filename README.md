# OtterSwap

OtterSwap is an AMM and CLOB hybrid model DEX (decentralized exchange) aiming to aggregate the DeFi and CeFi exchange liquidity, enhance users' capital utilization in V3 model, and reduce the Impermanent loss.

## Main Features

### Trading

We support quick and efficient swaps, allowing users to exchange their tokens seamlessly. In addition, we offer a gas-free limit order functionality where users can place orders by simply entering the desired quantity and price.

### Liquidity Pools

By leveraging the mechanism of Uniswap V3, users can provide AMM liquidity within specific price ranges, significantly improving capital utilization and trading potential, reducing the Impermanent loss.

### Aggregator

The protocol aggregates multiple liquidity pools and calculates the optimal trade execution path, enabling users to maximize their profits. It is designed as a brokerage that can aggregate both CeFi and DeFi liquidity.

## Roadmap

- We are actively researching and developing support for additional blockchain networks.
- And we're working on the development of LSD (liquidity staking derivatives) functionality to provide users with a more diverse range of services.
